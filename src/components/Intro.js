            Just a simple guy who lives, breathes, and dreams code, ready to
            create the next big thing! I have always believed that its easier to
            come up with good ideas when you have a better sense of what you are
            capable of with the skills you have. So I have always taken it upon
            myself to learn as much as I can about the things that interest me.
            I'm looking to join a team of passionate developers who will help me
            gain more experience as a full stack developer, and introduce me to
            new concepts along the way!
          </Typography>
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
    </Paper>

export default AboutMe;

// Trying to work on my design skills
// love working with React
// for the past 4 years ive been dabbling in various languages trying to find my way
// front-end and back-end
// love for making things
// to literally change the world
// my current stack includes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, Material UI Library
// maintained and developed multiple projects from scratch
// "I specialize in"

// For the last several years, I have been trying to figure out which
// path to take in my journey as a software developer. I learned things
// involving game development, artifical intelligence, creating mobile
// apps, automation tools, and so much more. It wasn't until I
// discovered React.js that I realized what my true passion was.
// Although I still have much to learn - especially when it comes to
// design - I think I have found what interests me the most and gives
// me as much flexibility in what I can create.
